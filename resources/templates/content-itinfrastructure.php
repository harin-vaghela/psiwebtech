          <p class="article_block_text">The recent recession has forced nearly every IT organization to rethink its approach. Where once you were asked to do a lot with a little, you're now forced to do even more with even less. Meeting the challenges require innovative ways to respond to changing business needs, improve flexibility, speed technology innovation, and provide higher business value. Our consulting, managed services and integrated solutions create agile, flexible IT environments.</p>
          <p class="article_block_text">Demand on IT infrastructure is growing as businesses grow increasingly dependent on automation to enter new markets and increase worker productivity.

The challenge for application infrastructure managers is to help direct cost to new revenue-generating business opportunities while overseeing the transformation from today's legacy to tomorrow's more dynamic infrastructure. Emerging as the main success drivers are the need for consistent, measurable results and end-to-end visibility.</p>
